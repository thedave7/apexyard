# PostToolUse hook: after `gh pr create` succeeds, tell Claude to invoke the
# code-reviewer agent (Rex) on the new PR automatically.
#
# Mechanism: the hook writes a pending-review marker and exits with code 2
# so the stderr message is surfaced back to Claude as an "error", which in
# practice is how Claude Code's PostToolUse hooks push the next instruction
# into the conversation. Exit 2 does NOT roll back the PR — it just nudges
# Claude to run the review immediately rather than "later".
#
# The marker file at .claude/session/pending-reviews/<pr> is also read by
# the merge-gate hook so a PR cannot be merged without a corresponding Rex
# approval file at .claude/session/reviews/<pr>-rex.approved.

AUTO CODE REVIEW REQUIRED

You just created ${PR_REF}. ApexYard requires the code-reviewer agent (Rex)
to run on every PR before it can be merged — see workflows/code-review.md
and .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md. Invoke Rex NOW using the Agent tool:

  subagent_type: code-reviewer
  prompt: "Review ${PR_REF} at ${PR_URL}. Check the diff, tests, coverage,
           AgDR linkage, glossary, and commit SHA consistency. Report verdict."

The merge-gate hook will block \`gh pr merge\` for this PR until a Rex approval
file exists at .claude/session/reviews/${PR_NUMBER:-<pr>}-rex.approved.

This message is a reminder from the PostToolUse hook, not a tool error. The PR
was created successfully.

exit 2
